# Hy Shell for QGIS

Turns the Python console shell into a Hy shell.

Everything should work as normal but using Hy syntax

You will need Hy installed to use:

```
pip install hy
```

# Usage

Toggle the `Hy!` button on the toolbar to active Hy mode in the console. Unsetting the button will revert to Python mode.

### Notes

You currently can't edit .hy files in the edtor tab.  Might happen, might not.
